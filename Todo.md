# Engine functionality
* **(Priority high)** Support linux builds

# Engine Architecture 
* **(Priority mid)** Introduce dependency injection

# Build System
* **(Priority low)** Switch subsystem from console to windows / use WinMain
* **(Priority low)** Create a static library build config for final builds

# Donsol
* **(Priority low)** Figure out if imgui can realistically be used for the UI or if styling will be a pain
